## Overview
Decided to take on this supposedly simple challenge after a long break and I really did not find it easy. I still have a lot to learn about css.

After submitting the first solution, I had to retry the project using CSS Flex. Not used to flexbox but I had to read it up
### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements
